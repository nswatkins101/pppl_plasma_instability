For my Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in the summer of 2020, I wrote these python codes to analyze data created from Gkeyll simulations of collisionless plasmas using the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. I use PyTorch to fit the data to theoretical models, leveraging automatic differentation abilities of PyTorch.
